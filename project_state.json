The root cause is in AdminGuard's sessionStorage checks, auth state passing, or backend authorization validation. Ensure that when an admin is authenticated, the AdminGuard correctly reads 'adminAuth' from sessionStorage, passes valid auth state to child routes, and the backend's role/authorization check for fetching all appointments succeeds without error.",
