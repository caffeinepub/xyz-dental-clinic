  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the 9 requirements (REQ-72 through REQ-80). REQ-72, REQ-73, REQ-74 (BookAppointmentDialog styling), REQ-75 (Footer tooth icon), REQ-76 (Header brand reload), REQ-77 (CustomCursor disabled), REQ-79 (animated mesh gradient in index.css), and REQ-80 (BeforeAfterSlider with mouse/touch drag) are all evidenced in the diff. REQ-78 requires scroll-reveal on ServicesGrid, DoctorProfile, TestimonialCarousel, BeforeAfterSlider gallery, and ContactSection on the home page, but none of those component files appear modified in the diff — only service detail pages show the scroll-reveal implementation.",

      "requirement": "ServicesGrid, DoctorProfile, TestimonialCarousel, BeforeAfterSlider gallery, and ContactSection must all fade in and slide up on scroll entry via IntersectionObserver.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include modifications to ServicesGrid.tsx, DoctorProfile.tsx, TestimonialCarousel.tsx, or ContactSection.tsx. While the CSS class and useScrollReveal hook exist and service detail pages use scroll reveal, the home-page component files are not shown as modified to apply the reveal animation.",
