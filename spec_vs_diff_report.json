  "summary": "The diff modifies BookAppointmentDialog.tsx to fix the unexpected 'Connection issue' banner. The implementation addresses all five acceptance criteria of REQ-1: clearing error state on dialog open, only showing the red error banner after a real failed submission (tracked via submissionFailed state), silently removing stale/empty localStorage entries, clearing localStorage on successful submission, and preserving Retry functionality for genuine failures.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "An amber 'Unsaved appointment found' banner is shown when localStorage contains valid data from a previous session, restoring form fields and displaying a separate informational notice.",
      "reason": "The build request only requires clearing stale localStorage data and preventing the red connection error banner from appearing incorrectly. It does not request an amber 'Unsaved appointment found' informational banner UI element. The diff introduces this as an additional UI state not mentioned in the requirements.",
