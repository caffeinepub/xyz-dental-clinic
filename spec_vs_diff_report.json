  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements (REQ-32 through REQ-38) with generally solid coverage. REQ-32 (Service Manager), REQ-33 (Review Approver), REQ-34 (Glassmorphism), REQ-35 (Scroll Progress Bar), REQ-36 (Floating Dental Elements), and REQ-37 (Magnetic Cursor) all have corresponding implementation. REQ-38 (static PNG assets in frontend/public/assets/generated) is referenced by components but the actual PNG files are not present in the diff as added files. One notable gap: REQ-33 requires showing the submission date in the Review Approver panel, which is not visible in the ReviewApprover component.",

      "requirement": "Admin panel Review Approver section must display submission date alongside patient name, review text, and star rating for each pending review.",
      "reason": "The ReviewApprover.tsx component renders reviewerName, text, and rating but there is no submission date field displayed. The Review type in backend/main.mo also does not appear to include a submittedAt/date field, and neither the backend nor frontend surface a submission date.",

The FloatingDentalElements component references tooth-float-icon.dim_96x96.png, dental-mirror-float-icon.dim_96x96.png, toothbrush-float-icon.dim_96x96.png, and plus-float-icon.dim_96x96.png, but no binary or image files appear in the added files list.",
