  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. REQ-62 (tooth logo footer trigger), REQ-63 (admin dashboard consolidation), REQ-64 (frictionless booking), REQ-65 (brand name reload), REQ-66 (cursor removal), REQ-67 (mesh gradient), REQ-68 (scroll reveal), REQ-69 (before/after slider), and REQ-70 (service card glow) are all at least partially addressed. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps or cannot be confirmed from the diff. The HiddenAdminTrigger removal from App.tsx cannot be fully confirmed since App.tsx is truncated. The Admin Dashboard consolidation into a single view is questionable since separate admin sub-pages still exist. The AdminGuard still uses Internet Identity. Some AC items are confirmed; others lack evidence.",
