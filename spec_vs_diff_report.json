  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required changes for frictionless zero-login appointment booking. The backend bookAppointment function is updated to accept anonymous calls (REQ-49), the BookAppointmentDialog is replaced with a frictionless four-field form (REQ-50), and the Header is updated to open the booking dialog directly (REQ-51 partial). However, there is no evidence in the diff that the service detail pages (DentalImplantsDetail, InvisalignDetail, LaserDentistryDetail, PediatricDentistryDetail, SmileMakeoverDetail, ServiceDetail) and HeroSection were audited and updated to remove auth-gating from their Book Appointment buttons, as required by REQ-51.",

      "requirement": "Audit all public-facing pages (HeroSection, DentalImplantsDetail, InvisalignDetail, LaserDentistryDetail, PediatricDentistryDetail, SmileMakeoverDetail, ServiceDetail) and remove any auth-gating logic from Book Appointment buttons so they open the frictionless dialog directly.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows Header.tsx was updated to open BookAppointmentDialog directly. There is no diff evidence that HeroSection, ServiceDetail, DentalImplantsDetail, InvisalignDetail, LaserDentistryDetail, PediatricDentistryDetail, or SmileMakeoverDetail were modified to remove auth-gating or wire up the frictionless booking dialog.",
