  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for the admin panel appointments loading issue (REQ-1). AdminGuard now correctly reads 'adminAuth' from sessionStorage and also verifies an active Internet Identity before granting access. HiddenAdminLoginModal sets sessionStorage after II login and navigates to the admin dashboard. The Appointments page uses the isAdminAuthenticated helper to conditionally enable the query. The backend main.mo is present with authorization logic. All changes align well with REQ-1's acceptance criteria.",
