  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-71 by adding a custom `.book-appointment-btn` CSS class to the BookAppointmentDialog submit button with a bright teal gradient background, white text, hover/active transitions, and glow shadow effects. The file summary confirms the submit button uses this custom CSS class instead of the default shadcn Button component. The index.css and project_state.json files are also modified to support this styling. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the available evidence.",
