# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Style the submit button in the BookAppointmentDialog with a bright teal/blue color so it stands out against the white form background.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply a bright teal or royal-blue background color (e.g., `#0D9488` or equivalent existing design token) to the "Book Appointment" / "Book Now" submit button inside `BookAppointmentDialog`
- Set button text to white for clear readability
- Add a hover state with a slightly darker teal/blue shade or subtle glow, using a CSS transition of ~200–300ms

**User-visible outcome:** The submit button in the booking dialog is visually prominent with a bright teal/blue background and white text, making it easy for users to identify and click, while the rest of the form remains white/light.
