# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all "Caffeine AI" branding, references, logos, and links from every part of the dental clinic website frontend.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all "Caffeine AI" text, logos, icons, and hyperlinks from the Footer component
- Remove all "Caffeine AI" text, logos, icons, and hyperlinks from the Header component
- Audit and remove all remaining "Caffeine AI" references from every other page and section component (Home, HeroSection, ContactSection, ServicesGrid, DoctorProfile, TestimonialCarousel, admin pages, etc.)

**User-visible outcome:** No "Caffeine AI" branding, attribution, or links appear anywhere on the website; all other content and functionality remains unchanged.
