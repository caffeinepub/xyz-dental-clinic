Please click \"Retry\" to try again' message does not appear unexpectedly. The error/retry banner should only be shown when there is an actual, confirmed network or canister call failure — not on initial load, not when localStorage contains stale data from a previous session, and not when the form has not yet been submitted. Clear any stale localStorage pending appointment data that would incorrectly trigger this state on mount.",
