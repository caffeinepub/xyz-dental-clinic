        "On hover, the button transitions to a slightly darker teal/blue shade or emits a subtle glow, with a CSS transition of approximately 200–300ms.",
        "The rest of the form (inputs, labels, dialog background) remains white/light.",
        "The button styling is consistent across all viewports (desktop and mobile).",

Apply white text color (text-white), add a hover state with a slightly darker teal shade (e.g., hover:bg-teal-600) or a subtle glow effect, and include a CSS transition property (transition-colors duration-200 or duration-300). Ensure all other form elements (inputs, labels, dialog background) remain unchanged with their existing white/light styling."
